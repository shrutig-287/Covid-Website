        <div class="paragraph">Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.
        To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, 
        avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</p>
            <h2 class="title"><strong>Why practice social distancing?</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person 
        coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">If you are sick with COVID-19, have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, it is important to stay home and away 
        from other people until it is safe to be around others. Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home.</p>

            <h2 class="title"><strong>How to maintain distance</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Tactics for social distancing include canceling large social gatherings, such as sports events and concerts, as well as closing schools, bars and restaurants, and having
        people work from home instead of an office. But it also means limiting any interaction with anyone beyond your immediate family, with whom you live.    </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Masks are especially important in times when physical distancing is difficult. Pay attention to any physical guides, such as tape markings on floors or signs on walls, 
        directing attendees to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other in lines or at other times. Allow other people 6 feet of space when you pass by them in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
             <h2 class="title"><strong>Some tips for Physical Distancing</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Consider the following tips for practicing social distancing when you decide to go out :</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listy"><strong>Prepare for Transportation:</strong> When using rideshares or taxis, avoid pooled rides where multiple passengers are picked up, and sit in the back seat in
                 larger vehicles so you can remain at least 6 feet away from the driver.</li>
            <li class="listy"><strong>Limit Contact When Running Errands:</strong> If possible, use drive-thru, curbside pick-up, or delivery services to limit face-to-face contact with others. 
                Maintain physical distance between yourself and delivery service providers during exchanges and wear a mask.</li>
            <li class="listy"><strong>Choose Safe Social Activities:</strong> It is possible to stay socially connected with friends and family who don’t live in your home by calling, using video 
                chat, or staying connected through social media.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In addition to practicing everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus
        and slowing its spread in communities.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread 
        the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you—or they—do not have any symptoms. Social distancing is especially
        important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
