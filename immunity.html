        <div class="paragraph">There are plenty of supplements and products in the grocery store that claim to help boost your immune
            system. But while it may sound like a no-brainer, boosting your immune system is actually much harder to
            accomplish than you might think &mdash; and for good reason.</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Your immune system is incredibly complex. It has to be strong enough and sophisticated enough to fight off a
            variety of illnesses and infections, but not so strong that it overreacts unnecessarily &mdash; causing
            allergies and other autoimmune disorders to develop. To operate in such a delicate balance, your immune
            system is tightly controlled by a variety of inputs.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But despite its complexity, there are everyday lifestyle habits you can focus on to help give your immune
            system what it needs to fight off an infection or illness. Here are five science-backed ways to ensure your
            immune system has everything it needs to function optimally, as well as why you shouldn't rely on
            supplements to boost your immune system.</p><br><br>

        <h2 class="title"><strong>Maintain a healthy diet</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">As with most things in your body, a healthy diet is key to a strong immune system. This means making sure you
            eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, lean protein and <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"

                target="_blank">healthy fats</a>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In addition to providing your immune system the energy it needs, a healthy diet can help ensure you're
            getting sufficient amounts of the micronutrients that play a role in maintaining your immune system,
            including:</p>
            <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listy"><strong>Vitamin B6</strong>, found in chicken, salmon, tuna, bananas, green vegetables and potatoes
                (with the skin)</li>
            <li class="listy"><strong>Vitamin C</strong>, found in citrus fruit, including oranges and strawberries, as well as
                tomatoes, broccoli and spinach</li>
            <li class="listy"><strong>Vitamin E</strong>, found in almonds, sunflower and safflower oil, sunflower seeds, peanut
                butter and spinach</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since experts believe that your body absorbs vitamins more efficiently from dietary sources, rather than
            supplements, the best way to support your immune system is to eat a well-balanced diet.</p>
        <h2 class="title"><strong>Exercise regularly</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Physical activity isn't just for building muscles and helping yourself de-stress &mdash; it's also an
            important part of being healthy and supporting a healthy immune system.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">One way exercise may improve immune function is by boosting your overall circulation, making it easier for
            immune cells and other infection-fighting molecules to travel more easily throughout your body.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In fact, studies have shown that engaging in as little as 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise every
            day helps stimulate your immune system. This means it's important to focus on staying active and getting
            regular exercise.</p>
        <h2 class="title"><strong>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Water plays many important roles in your body, including supporting your immune system. A fluid in your
            circulatory system called lymph, which carries important infection-fighting immune cells around your body,
            is largely made up of water. Being dehydrated slows down the movement of lymph, sometimes leading to an
            impaired immune system.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Even if you're not exercising or sweating, you're constantly losing water through your breath, as well as
            through your urine and bowel movements. To help support your immune system, be sure you're replacing the
            water you lose with water you can use &mdash; which starts with knowing <a rel="noopener noreferrer"

        <br><h2 class="title"><strong>Get plenty of sleep</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Sleep certainly doesn't feel like an active process, but there are plenty of important activities happening
            in your body when you're not awake &mdash; even if you don't realize it. For instance, important
            infection-fighting molecules are created while you sleep.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Studies have shown that people who don't get enough quality sleep are more prone to getting sick after
            exposure to viruses, such as those that cause the common cold. To give your immune system the best chance to
            fight off infection and illness, it's important to know <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2019/oct/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need/"
                target="_blank">how much sleep you should be getting every night</a>, as well as the steps to take if
            your sleep is suffering.</p>
        <h2 class="title"><strong>Minimize stress</strong></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Whether it comes on quick or builds over time, it's important to understand how stress affects your health
            &mdash; including the impact it has on your immune system. During a period of stress, particularly chronic
            stress that's frequent and long-lasting, your body responds by initiating a stress response. This stress
            response, in turn, suppresses your immune system &mdash; increasing your chance of infection or illness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Stress is different for everyone, and how we relieve it is, too. Given the effect it can have on your health,
            it's important to know how to identify stress. And, whether it's deep breathing, mediation, prayer or
            exercise, you should also get familiar with the activities that help you reduce stress.</p>
